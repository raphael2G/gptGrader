# overview

From the managing course side of things, there are three buttons. Assignments, students, and grading. This document corresponds to the studetns side of things. 

Our goal is going to be simply displaying all students in the course. This should be a relatively easy feature to implement, but just want to document everything that is necesary before I start building


# desired flow
1. viewing all studnets

this screen pops up whenever we first click on the students section of the course. This will make a big list of all students in the course, as well as some easy to claculate relevnt infromation, like their name, email, and anything else. 

2. Viewing individual students

Whenever we click on an individual studnet to look at from the previous screen, we should get another list of this students performance on all of the assignments so far. Let display row by row for each assignment in the course so far. We should be able to see the assignment name, if the student submitted it on time, late, or not at all. the grade the student recieved out of how many points the assignment was worth. 

3. Viewing individul studnets performance on individual assignmnet

Whenever we click to view a studnets performance on a specific assignment (clicked from 2. ), we should be able to view how that student performed on each question of that assignmetn. there are two pieces of infomration we are trying to view here. one is how the student performed across all questions, and another is how responded to each questions. We need to come up with some balance whcih allows us to understand their overall performance across all quesitons, as well as their individual performance across individual questions.
