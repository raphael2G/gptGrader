Lets make the first section be an overview on what we are going to make. The next section will be a step by step description on how we are going to build it. 

the first step is simply making it so when you click a student, it opens up a new page dedicated to analyzing their performance in the class

the next step is to add the list of assignments on the left side of the screen. The left column will be the assignment, the right column will be the # of poitns they earned, followed by a slash, followed by teh number of points in the assignmnet

the next step will be to implement an empty scatter plot or histogram with no data

the next step will be to make the x axis the assignment, and the y axis their percentage on that assignment.
